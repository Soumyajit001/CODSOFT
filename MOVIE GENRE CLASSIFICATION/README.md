## Movie Genre Prediction
Movie Genre Classification using TF-IDF and Naive BayesÂ¶
Aim is to build a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information. To achieve this, we will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), in conjunction with the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.

The primary goal is to create a model that can automatically assign one or more genres to a movie based on the textual description provided. This can be valuable for categorizing and organizing movies in databases, recommendation systems, and content filtering.
