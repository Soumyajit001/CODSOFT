# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Problem Statement
The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
 
 ## About the Dataset

This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

 ## Source of Simulation

 This was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were combined and converted into a standard format.
