# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

## What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customers loyalty. The core to succeed in this market lies in the customer itself.

Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.

To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels.As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also grow and thrive. More customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategy.

## Problem Statement
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

## About Dataset

It is the dataset of a U.S. bank customer for getting the information that , this particular customer will leave bank or not.
Various Bank detail is given like CustomerID , surname, Credit score and many more.

## Implementation:
Libraries: sklearn, Matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and NumPy

## Project Pipeline
The project pipeline can be briefly summarized in the following four steps:

## Step - 1
### Data Understanding:
Here, we need to load the data and understand the features present in it. This would help us choose the features that we will need for your final model.

## Step - 2
### Exploratory data analytics (EDA):
Normally, in this step, we need to perform univariate and bivariate analyses of the data, followed by feature transformations, if necessary. However, we can check if there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model-building phase.

## Step - 3
### Train/Test Split:
Now we are familiar with the train/test split, which we can perform in order to check the performance of our models with unseen data.

## Step - 4
### Try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting

## Step - 5
### Model Evaluation: 
We need to evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
